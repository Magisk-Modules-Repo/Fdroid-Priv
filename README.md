# F-Droid Privileged Extension installer

![Magisk](http://i.imgur.com/WA4LBkF.png)

This is an unofficial installer of the F-Droid Privileged Extension. With the power of Magisk, this is done systemlessly.

What to know:

* Please make sure you're running at least F-Droid 0.103
* Requires Magisk 17+
* If running Android 11+, I suggest using [Aurora Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.adroid/) and [Aurora Services](https://github.com/whyorean/AuroraServices). F-Droid does not seem interested in updating their installer extension, and I will of course update this module when F-Droid updates their extension.
