# F-Droid Privileged Extension installer

![Magisk](http://i.imgur.com/WA4LBkF.png)

This is an unofficial installer of the F-Droid Privileged Extension. With the power of Magisk, this is done systemlessly.

[XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-f-droid-privileged-extension-t3587068#post71796001)


Known Issues:

* F-Droid will not update the extension (has to be updated via this Magisk module)
* When F-Droid is installing an app, the download notification will remain even after the app has installed. You can simply tap "cancel" on the notification to dismiss it.
* Both of these issues are due to the extension not officially being supported on Android 5.1+. So I can't do anything until F-Droid supports 5.1+ officially.
